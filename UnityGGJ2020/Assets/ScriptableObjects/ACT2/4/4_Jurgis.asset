  sentences: 'I ran a few tests, and I think I managed to isolate the issue: some
    of the wiring from the control room leading to the battery compartment were tangled,
    and the turbulence must have damaged them. Look for broken electric panels in
    the CREW''S SPACE; a lot of the radio wiring go through them. By the way, if
    you need fasteners - like screws, bolts, or nuts - you''ll have to hunt down
    Kazimir. He''s been hoarding them again.'
