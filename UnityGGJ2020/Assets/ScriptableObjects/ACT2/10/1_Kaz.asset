  sentences: Did you know that I once won a game of chess against Gary Kasparov?
    It's true. We were both very young when I first met him during the USSR Chess
    Championship of 1981. We tied for first place, but as far as the government was
    concerned, *he* was the champion. Not me. What country would want their chess
    champion to have a lazy eye? That could've been *me*, but no, of course it wasn't.
    I ended up in the army instead. Now look at what I've become.
